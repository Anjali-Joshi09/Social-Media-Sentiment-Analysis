# Social-Media-Sentiment-Analysis
This project is a social media sentiment analysis system developed using Python and Flask. It connects to popular platforms like Reddit, YouTube, and Tumblr through their APIs and uses OAuth authentication for secure access. The system collects posts and comments, processes them, and applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to determine whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. A dedicated Flask server is used for handling API callbacks, while the core scripts manage data collection and analysis. The project is designed with deployment support on AWS cloud services, making it scalable and suitable for real-world applications. It demonstrates skills in API integration, web development, sentiment analysis, and cloud computing.
